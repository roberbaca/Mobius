The Möbius strip has several curious properties. A line drawn along the edge travels in a full circle to a point opposite the starting point. If continued, the line returns to the starting point, and is double the length of the original strip: this single continuous curve traverses the entire boundary.

Your ship has the ability to bend the space as a Möbius strip !
